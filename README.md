## Project Description
This is a website project with golang for backend and react for frontend. 
This project allows people to search foods and restaurants by entering zip code, with different zip codes the backend will return different results. 

There are 2 types of users, normal users and restaurant users. 
When signing up as a normal user, the website will ask you to enter your email and password. 
When signing up as a restaurant, except for the elements mentioned above, the user also needs to enter the zipcode and the name of the restaurant.

When signed in as a normal user, the user will see a search block in the home page, 
the user can also access the shopping cart, payment method, and user profile through the navbar, 
and the user can edit his/her profile by changing the information in the input block.

When signed in as a restaurant, the user could not search or order foods, but it can manage the menu and order from users insteadly.
